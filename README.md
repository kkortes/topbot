topbot
======

Small and easy to set up layout-theme for creation of any website.

I've come to the conclusion that every website (almost at least) on the internet shares some equal denominators.
Therefore I don't see the reason to re-create code when setting up a new website-project. So I created topbot.

Top and bot are used for what you would call header and footer, but hold on! There's more to it. 
You can duplicated either one of them and it still looks great, they are not unique. 
This means they're independent but can still be used as header and footer (HTML5 header and footer are also supported).


- New! Grunt added. For those who don't want to compile with Codekit.
- New! Topbot now includes Leaf! Leaf is a css framework based on Google's Material Design.

- Topbot now includes crow! Crow is a grid css framework for awesome box alignment within rows.

- .htaccess added! Of course possible to remove if not desired. Uses "smart"-url with the 
  structure /topbot/pagename/variable/value/variable2/value2?variable3=value3 you can go as far as you like!
- Try put a img-tag anywhere and watch the magic!
- The scrollbar always shows (check to the right), this prevents page from "sliding back and fourth" 
  upon page navigation
- The theme uses smart sticky bot (footer) - the content of bot may be dynamic (normally you set a height 
  for this to work properly)

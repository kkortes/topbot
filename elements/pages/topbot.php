				<h2>Philosophy</h2>
				<p>Coding for the web is fun. There are thousands of possibilities for every new project. Just the thought of starting something brand new up is exciting. I think all of us have had that "let's get going!"-phase at the start of a project. New fresh design, some cool code logics and a, eventually, awesome final product! YEAAA LET'S DOO THIS!
				<br /><br />
				However, you get stuck... You get stuck loads of times.
				<br /><br />
				If it isn't the javascript, it's the php. If it's not the php, it's the node server you set up. If it's not the node server, it's the database. There's always something stopping you from going fast. You know what to do, but you can't get it done fast enought (fast enought = as close as possible to instant).
				</p>
				<h3>I know this, because I went through it</h3>
				<p>I'm not here to give you a direct solution to this. Frankly, there aren't any. Projects take time. They are meant to. Without your personal expertise and the time your put into a project the website will just be a placeholder for a <i>could-have-been-a-much-cooler-site</i>.
				<br /><br />
				We all got our cozy little optimized workflows, pre-templated libraries we use, markup themes and code snippets.
				<br />
				Good for us.
				</p>

				<h3>But.</h3>

				</p>
	      <p>All web projects have some common denominators. That's a fact. So why not collect those into one package and start from there everything, rather than starting from scratch? I know, there's a lot of bootstraps and boilerplates out there already, but topbot is <strong><?=date('Y')?></strong>.
	      </p>

				<h2>So what is topbot?</h2>
	      <p>Topbot is a fully responsive minimalist no-style-theme.
	      </p>
	      <p>I've taken all the similarities in every web project and put them together in a lightweight, easy to understand and use - package.
				</p>
	      <p>Get to know topbot! You won't regret it.
